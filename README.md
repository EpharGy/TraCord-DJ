### 🛠️ For Developers

**Branches available:**
- `main` - Stable releases only
- `dev` - Active development (use this for contributions)

**Quick start:**
```bash
python gui.py  # Run the GUI application
```

## Running the Bot

### 🚀 GUI Application (Recommended)

```

## Building & Distribution

### 🏗️ Building for Distribution

Create a standalone executable for users without Python:

```bash
# Quick build (Windows)
build.bat

# Manual build
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python build.py
```

Output: `dist/TraCord-DJ-GUI.exe`

### 📦 Distribution Notes
- Executable is fully portable and self-contained
- First run creates `.env` file with setup instructions
- No Python installation required for end users
- Can be run from any directory

## 🧩 Extending with Discord Cogs (Plugins)

This bot uses a dynamic cog loader! To add new features or commands, simply drop a `.py` file into the `cogs/` folder (if using EXE, create one where the exe is launched from). The bot will automatically load all cogs in this folder at startup—no need to edit the main code!

- **To add a new cog:**
  1. Place your `my_cool_feature.py` in the `cogs/` folder.
  2. Restart the bot. That's it! Your cog will be loaded automatically.
- **To remove a cog:**
  1. Delete or move the `.py` file from `cogs/`.
  2. Restart the bot.

> **Note for Contributors:** The `_internal_cogs.py` file is auto-managed and contains an always-up-to-date list of internal cogs. Do not edit this file manually.

## Project Structure

The bot uses a modular Discord.py Cogs architecture for better organization:

## ⚙️ Cog Loading Behavior

- All cogs in `cogs/` are always loaded and should be included in packaged builds.
- Any `.py` files in `extra_cogs/` (top-level only) are also loaded as cogs when running from source, but are **not** included in the EXE unless you add `--add-data=extra_cogs;extra_cogs` to your build.
- Errors for missing cogs in `extra_cogs` are suppressed for a clean dev experience.
- Use `extra_cogs/` for personal, experimental, or private cogs and files. This folder is gitignored by default.
